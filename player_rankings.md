title: Player Rankings

This page is a work in progress. I've wanted to get a table of player ratings up in some form, but haven't found a perfect solution yet, and may end up moving to another Streamlit app, as that seems the simplest way to allow for the filtering I'd like to do, and would allow for 'zooming in' on a player to show some historical performances or to mess around with the ranks and do things like pick your own lineup and see how they'd do against some opponents. Hopefully all coming soon - if that, or anything else like it, sound like something you'd like, [head on over to the patreon or the email and let me know](https://linktr.ee/Rugbyclubranks).

For now, enjoy this somewhat interactive table. Some of the data is a bit out of date, and players who have played fewer matches or within just one competition may be grossly over-ranked or under-ranked.
