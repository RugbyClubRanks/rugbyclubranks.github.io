This site will eventually contain a suite of visualizations and statistics focused on elo scores for individual rugby players, at all levels of professional competition. With this, player development can be traced over time, a match between Leinster and Ireland or the Crusaders and All Blacks can be simulated, and lots of fancy statistics can be displayed.
