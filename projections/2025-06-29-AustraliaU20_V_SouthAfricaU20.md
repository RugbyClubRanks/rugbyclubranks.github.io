# Club Level Predictions


The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model is currently predicting Australia U20 to win by 6.46.

Our Over/Under is 13.5 - and combined with the spread above, we have a predicted scoreline of 10 to 4

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (similar to a Glicko rating), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.
