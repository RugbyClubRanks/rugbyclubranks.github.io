# Club Level Predictions


The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model is currently predicting Wales U20 to win by 7.63.

Our Over/Under is 17.5 - and combined with the spread above, we have a predicted scoreline of 13 to 5

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (similar to a Glicko rating), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.
