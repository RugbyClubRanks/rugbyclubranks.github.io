# Club Level Predictions


The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model is currently predicting Scotland Women to win by 0.94.

Our Over/Under is 47.5 - and combined with the spread above, we have a predicted scoreline of 24 to 23

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (similar to a Glicko rating), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.
