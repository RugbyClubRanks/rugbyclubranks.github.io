The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model is currently predicting Glasgow Warriors to win by 2.81.

Our Over/Under is 49.5 - and combined with the spread above, we have a predicted scoreline of 26 to 23

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (similar to a Glicko rating), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.
