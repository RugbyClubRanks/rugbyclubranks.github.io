The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model is currently predicting Blue Bulls to win by 4.2.

Our Over/Under is 63.5 - and combined with the spread above, we have a predicted scoreline of 34 to 30
