# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Japan to win by 9.3, and Japan won by 42.0. That's an absolute error of 32.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 8.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 55.5 and we have an actual total of 72.0. That's an absolute error of 16.5 compared to a six month average of 14.0. This prediction was more accurate than 33.3% of my recent predictions.
