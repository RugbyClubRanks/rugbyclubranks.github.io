# Southland V Tasman on 2025/09/26, 38.0 to 55.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Tasman to win by 1.38, and Tasman won by 17.0. That's an absolute error of 15.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 35.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 68.5 and we have an actual total of 93.0. That's an absolute error of 24.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 15.2% of my recent predictions.
