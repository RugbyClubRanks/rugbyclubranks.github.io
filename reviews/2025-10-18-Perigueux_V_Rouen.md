# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Perigueux to win by 3.66, and Perigueux won by 12.0. That's an absolute error of 8.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 59.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 42.5 and we have an actual total of 40.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 88.1% of my recent predictions.
