# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Uruguay to win by 2.35, and Uruguay won by 10.0. That's an absolute error of 7.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 61.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 52.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 86.9% of my recent predictions.
