This prediction was more accurate than 99.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 73. That's an absolute error of 16.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 31.8% of my recent predictions.
