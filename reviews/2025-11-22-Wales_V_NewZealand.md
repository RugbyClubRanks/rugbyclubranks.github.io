# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand to win by 7.76, and New Zealand won by 26.0. That's an absolute error of 18.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 27.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 63.5 and we have an actual total of 78.0. That's an absolute error of 14.5 compared to a six month average of 13.0. This prediction was more accurate than 35.7% of my recent predictions.
