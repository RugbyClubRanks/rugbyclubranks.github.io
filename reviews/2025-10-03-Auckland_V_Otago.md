# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Otago to win by 2.94, and Otago won by 34.0. That's an absolute error of 31.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.4 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 8.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 58.5 and we have an actual total of 68.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 14.3. This prediction was more accurate than 58.9% of my recent predictions.
