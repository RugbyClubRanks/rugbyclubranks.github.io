# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Leinster to win by 2.67, and Leinster won by 9.0. That's an absolute error of 6.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 67.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 68.5 and we have an actual total of 35.0. That's an absolute error of 33.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 4.0% of my recent predictions.
