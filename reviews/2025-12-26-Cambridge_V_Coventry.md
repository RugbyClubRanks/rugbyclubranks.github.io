# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Coventry to win by 11.02, and Coventry won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 3.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 85.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 84.5 and we have an actual total of 52.0. That's an absolute error of 32.5 compared to a six month average of 12.8. This prediction was more accurate than 4.6% of my recent predictions.
