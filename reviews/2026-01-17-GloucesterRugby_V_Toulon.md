# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Toulon to win by 0.26, and Toulon won by 17.0. That's an absolute error of 16.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 29.9% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 45.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 53.4% of my recent predictions.
