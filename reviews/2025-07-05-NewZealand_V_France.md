# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand to win by 2.08, and New Zealand won by 4.0. That's an absolute error of 1.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 89.9% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 58.0. That's an absolute error of 6.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 71.0% of my recent predictions.
