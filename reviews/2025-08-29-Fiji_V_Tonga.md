# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Fiji to win by 15.33, and Fiji won by 22.0. That's an absolute error of 6.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 68.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 42.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 14.0. This prediction was more accurate than 45.4% of my recent predictions.
