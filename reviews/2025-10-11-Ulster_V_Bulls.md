# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Bulls to win by 1.33, and Ulster won by 21.0. That's an absolute error of 22.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.0 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 19.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 60.5 and we have an actual total of 35.0. That's an absolute error of 25.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 13.8% of my recent predictions.
