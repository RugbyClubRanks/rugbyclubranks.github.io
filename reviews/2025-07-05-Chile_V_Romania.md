# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Chile to win by 3.9, and Chile won by 24. That's an absolute error of 20.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 22.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 56. That's an absolute error of 8.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 60.0% of my recent predictions.
