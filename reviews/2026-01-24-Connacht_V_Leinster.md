# Connacht V Leinster on 2026/01/24, 23.0 to 34.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Leinster to win by 1.7, and Leinster won by 11.0. That's an absolute error of 9.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 51.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 57.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 87.9% of my recent predictions.
