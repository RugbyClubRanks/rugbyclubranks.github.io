# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted South Africa to win by 12.44, and South Africa won by 8.0. That's an absolute error of 4.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.3 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 78.6% of my recent predictions.
