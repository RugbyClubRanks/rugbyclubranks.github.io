# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Australia U20 to win by 6.46, and South Africa U20 won by 56. That's an absolute error of 62.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 1.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 55.5 and we have an actual total of 90. That's an absolute error of 34.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 5.1% of my recent predictions.
