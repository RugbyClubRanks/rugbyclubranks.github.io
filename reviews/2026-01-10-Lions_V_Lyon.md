# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Lions to win by 3.24, and Lions won by 9.0. That's an absolute error of 5.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 69.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 55.5 and we have an actual total of 75.0. That's an absolute error of 19.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 21.9% of my recent predictions.
