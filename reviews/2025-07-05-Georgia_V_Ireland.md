# Georgia V Ireland on 2025/07/05, 5 to 34

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Georgia to win by 0.2, and Ireland won by 29. That's an absolute error of 29.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 9.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 39. That's an absolute error of 8.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 60.0% of my recent predictions.
