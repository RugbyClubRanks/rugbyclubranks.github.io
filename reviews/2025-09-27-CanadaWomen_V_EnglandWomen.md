# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted England Women to win by 1.23, and England Women won by 20.0. That's an absolute error of 18.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 28.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 46.0. That's an absolute error of 4.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 79.1% of my recent predictions.
