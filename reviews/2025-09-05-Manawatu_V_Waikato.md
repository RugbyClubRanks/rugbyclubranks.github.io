# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Waikato to win by 0.14, and Manawatu won by 10.0. That's an absolute error of 10.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 52.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 65.5 and we have an actual total of 62.0. That's an absolute error of 3.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 83.9% of my recent predictions.
