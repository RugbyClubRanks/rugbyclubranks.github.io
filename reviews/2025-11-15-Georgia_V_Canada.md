# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Georgia to win by 12.11, and Georgia won by 21.0. That's an absolute error of 8.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 55.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 55.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 92.2% of my recent predictions.
