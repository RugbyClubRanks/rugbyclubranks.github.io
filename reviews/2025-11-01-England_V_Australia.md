# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted England to win by 5.78, and England won by 18.0. That's an absolute error of 12.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 43.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 48.5 and we have an actual total of 32.0. That's an absolute error of 16.5 compared to a six month average of 13.4. This prediction was more accurate than 31.4% of my recent predictions.
