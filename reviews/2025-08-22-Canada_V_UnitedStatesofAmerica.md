# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted United States of America to win by 3.18, and Canada won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 17.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 30.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 54.0. That's an absolute error of 3.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 83.3% of my recent predictions.
