# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Blue Bulls to win by 7.08, and Pumas won by 34.0. That's an absolute error of 41.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 4.5% of my recent predictions.
