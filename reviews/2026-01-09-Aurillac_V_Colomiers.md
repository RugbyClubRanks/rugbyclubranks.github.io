This prediction was more accurate than 93.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 48.5 and we have an actual total of 29.0. That's an absolute error of 19.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 21.9% of my recent predictions.
