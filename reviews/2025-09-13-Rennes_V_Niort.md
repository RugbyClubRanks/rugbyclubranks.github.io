# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Niort to win by 4.12, and Rennes won by 5.0. That's an absolute error of 9.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 56.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 43.5 and we have an actual total of 29.0. That's an absolute error of 14.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 37.5% of my recent predictions.
