# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Wales U20 to win by 10.9, and Wales U20 won by 10.0. That's an absolute error of 0.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 95.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 60.5 and we have an actual total of 60.0. That's an absolute error of 0.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 97.2% of my recent predictions.
