# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Munster to win by 9.43, and Munster won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 7.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 61.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 42.0. That's an absolute error of 5.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 72.5% of my recent predictions.
