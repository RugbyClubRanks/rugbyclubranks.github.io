# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Uruguay to win by 1.22, and Uruguay won by 18.0. That's an absolute error of 16.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 30.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 59.5 and we have an actual total of 34.0. That's an absolute error of 25.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 12.9% of my recent predictions.
