# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted North Harbour to win by 3.26, and North Harbour won by 1.0. That's an absolute error of 2.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.4 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 89.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 73.5 and we have an actual total of 29.0. That's an absolute error of 44.5 compared to a six month average of 14.3. This prediction was more accurate than 2.7% of my recent predictions.
