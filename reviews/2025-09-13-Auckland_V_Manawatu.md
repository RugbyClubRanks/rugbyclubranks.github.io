# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Auckland to win by 2.0, and Auckland won by 23.0. That's an absolute error of 21.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 22.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 62.5 and we have an actual total of 81.0. That's an absolute error of 18.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 25.9% of my recent predictions.
