# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Newman to win by 0.34, and Newman won by 24.0. That's an absolute error of 23.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 15.6% of my recent predictions.
