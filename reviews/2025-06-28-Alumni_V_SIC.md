# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Alumni to win by 3.03, and SIC won by 24. That's an absolute error of 27.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 11.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 48.5 and we have an actual total of 72. That's an absolute error of 23.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 17.1% of my recent predictions.
