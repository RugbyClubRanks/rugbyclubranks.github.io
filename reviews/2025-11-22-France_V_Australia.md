# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted France to win by 6.97, and France won by 15.0. That's an absolute error of 8.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 59.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 81.0. That's an absolute error of 26.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 11.2% of my recent predictions.
