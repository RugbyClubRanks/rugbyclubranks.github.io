# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Colomiers to win by 5.58, and Colomiers won by 26.0. That's an absolute error of 20.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.4 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 23.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 48.5 and we have an actual total of 36.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 14.3. This prediction was more accurate than 48.4% of my recent predictions.
