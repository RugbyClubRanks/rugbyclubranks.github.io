# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Colomiers to win by 5.92, and Colomiers won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 8.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 61.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 45.5 and we have an actual total of 14.0. That's an absolute error of 31.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 7.1% of my recent predictions.
