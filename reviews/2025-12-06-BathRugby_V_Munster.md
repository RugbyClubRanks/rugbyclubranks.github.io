# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Bath Rugby to win by 5.11, and Bath Rugby won by 26.0. That's an absolute error of 20.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 22.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 46.5 and we have an actual total of 54.0. That's an absolute error of 7.5 compared to a six month average of 13.0. This prediction was more accurate than 63.1% of my recent predictions.
