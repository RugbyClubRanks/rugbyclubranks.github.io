# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Toulon to win by 5.7, and Toulon won by 4.0. That's an absolute error of 1.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 91.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 45.5 and we have an actual total of 28.0. That's an absolute error of 17.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 29.1% of my recent predictions.
