# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Bristol Rugby to win by 3.55, and Bristol Rugby won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 91.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 53.5 and we have an actual total of 36.0. That's an absolute error of 17.5 compared to a six month average of 12.5. This prediction was more accurate than 26.1% of my recent predictions.
