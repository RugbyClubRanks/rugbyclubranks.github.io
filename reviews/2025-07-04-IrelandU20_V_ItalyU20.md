# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Ireland U20 to win by 4.54, and Italy U20 won by 2. That's an absolute error of 6.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 67.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 45.5 and we have an actual total of 34. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 48.2% of my recent predictions.
