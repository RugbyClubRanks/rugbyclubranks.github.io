# Manawatu V Hawke's Bay on 2025/10/04, 10.0 to 38.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Hawke's Bay to win by 6.01, and Hawke's Bay won by 28.0. That's an absolute error of 22.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 20.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 71.5 and we have an actual total of 48.0. That's an absolute error of 23.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 16.8% of my recent predictions.
