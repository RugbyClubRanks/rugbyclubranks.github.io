# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Rouen to win by 3.56, and Rouen won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 1.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 92.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 38.5 and we have an actual total of 22.0. That's an absolute error of 16.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 32.1% of my recent predictions.
