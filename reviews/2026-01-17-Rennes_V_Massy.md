# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Massy to win by 1.14, and Massy won by 4.0. That's an absolute error of 2.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 85.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 38.5 and we have an actual total of 24.0. That's an absolute error of 14.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 35.0% of my recent predictions.
