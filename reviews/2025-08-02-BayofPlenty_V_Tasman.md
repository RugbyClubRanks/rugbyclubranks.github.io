# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Bay of Plenty to win by 4.68, and Bay of Plenty won by 30.0. That's an absolute error of 25.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 14.5% of my recent predictions.
