# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted United States of America to win by 5.48, and United States of America won by 19.0. That's an absolute error of 13.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 39.1% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 53.0. That's an absolute error of 5.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 75.5% of my recent predictions.
