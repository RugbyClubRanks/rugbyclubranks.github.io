# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Italy to win by 5.01, and Italy won by 15.0. That's an absolute error of 10.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 50.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 53.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 13.0. This prediction was more accurate than 87.8% of my recent predictions.
