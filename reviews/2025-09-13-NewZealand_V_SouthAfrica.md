# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand to win by 4.24, and South Africa won by 33.0. That's an absolute error of 37.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 6.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 53.0. That's an absolute error of 3.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 84.3% of my recent predictions.
