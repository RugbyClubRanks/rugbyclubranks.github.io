# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Belgium to win by 11.77, and Belgium won by 3.0. That's an absolute error of 8.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 56.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 57.0. That's an absolute error of 7.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 63.2% of my recent predictions.
