# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Rennes to win by 3.81, and Rennes won by 4.0. That's an absolute error of 0.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 98.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 39.5 and we have an actual total of 16.0. That's an absolute error of 23.5 compared to a six month average of 13.0. This prediction was more accurate than 15.4% of my recent predictions.
