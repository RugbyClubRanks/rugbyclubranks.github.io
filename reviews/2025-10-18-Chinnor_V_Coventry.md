# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Coventry to win by 0.93, and Chinnor won by 21.0. That's an absolute error of 21.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 20.1% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 61.5 and we have an actual total of 73.0. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 49.0% of my recent predictions.
