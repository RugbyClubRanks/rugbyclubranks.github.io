# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Samoa to win by 4.72, and Samoa won by 18.0. That's an absolute error of 13.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 37.9% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 34.0. That's an absolute error of 15.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 34.3% of my recent predictions.
