# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Belgium to win by 6.77, and Belgium won by 7.0. That's an absolute error of 0.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 98.3% of my recent predictions.
