# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Toulon to win by 3.73, and Toulon won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 1.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 90.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 52.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 88.4% of my recent predictions.
