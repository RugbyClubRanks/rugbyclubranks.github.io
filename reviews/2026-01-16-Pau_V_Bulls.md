# Pau V Bulls on 2026/01/16, 24.0 to 26.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Pau to win by 2.99, and Bulls won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 5.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 74.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 61.5 and we have an actual total of 50.0. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 46.1% of my recent predictions.
