# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Munster to win by 0.63, and Munster won by 16.0. That's an absolute error of 15.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 34.8% of my recent predictions.
