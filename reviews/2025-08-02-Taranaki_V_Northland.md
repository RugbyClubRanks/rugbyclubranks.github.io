This prediction was more accurate than 52.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 53.5 and we have an actual total of 26.0. That's an absolute error of 27.5 compared to a six month average of 14.0. This prediction was more accurate than 11.6% of my recent predictions.
