# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Ulster to win by 2.26, and Ulster won by 25.0. That's an absolute error of 22.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 19.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 42.5 and we have an actual total of 31.0. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 12.5. This prediction was more accurate than 44.6% of my recent predictions.
