# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Fiji to win by 3.54, and Fiji won by 8.0. That's an absolute error of 4.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 76.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 62.5 and we have an actual total of 74.0. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 47.4% of my recent predictions.
