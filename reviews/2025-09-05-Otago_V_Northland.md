# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Otago to win by 5.14, and Otago won by 19.0. That's an absolute error of 13.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 39.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 53.5 and we have an actual total of 39.0. That's an absolute error of 14.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 38.0% of my recent predictions.
