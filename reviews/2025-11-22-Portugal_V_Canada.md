# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Portugal to win by 5.24, and Portugal won by 6.0. That's an absolute error of 0.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 95.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 58.5 and we have an actual total of 60.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 compared to a six month average of 13.0. This prediction was more accurate than 91.8% of my recent predictions.
