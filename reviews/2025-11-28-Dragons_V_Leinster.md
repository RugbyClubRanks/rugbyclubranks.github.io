# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Leinster to win by 8.16, and Leinster won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 5.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 69.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 64.5 and we have an actual total of 34.0. That's an absolute error of 30.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 6.1% of my recent predictions.
