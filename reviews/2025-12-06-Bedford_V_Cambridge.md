# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Bedford to win by 15.45, and Bedford won by 1.0. That's an absolute error of 14.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 36.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 66.5 and we have an actual total of 57.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 54.2% of my recent predictions.
