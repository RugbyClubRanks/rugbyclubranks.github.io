# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted SIC to win by 7.83, and SIC won by 9.0. That's an absolute error of 1.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 94.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 31.0. That's an absolute error of 18.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 27.1% of my recent predictions.
