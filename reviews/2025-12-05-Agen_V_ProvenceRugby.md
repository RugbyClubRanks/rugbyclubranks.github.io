# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Agen to win by 0.75, and Agen won by 4.0. That's an absolute error of 3.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 83.7% of my recent predictions.
