# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted South Africa to win by 13.73, and South Africa won by 45.0. That's an absolute error of 31.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 7.3% of my recent predictions.
