# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted North Harbour to win by 3.52, and Manawatu won by 13.0. That's an absolute error of 16.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 32.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 68.5 and we have an actual total of 63.0. That's an absolute error of 5.5 compared to a six month average of 14.0. This prediction was more accurate than 75.2% of my recent predictions.
