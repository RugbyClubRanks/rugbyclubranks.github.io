# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Ireland U20 to win by 5.71, and Scotland U20 won by 1.0. That's an absolute error of 6.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 67.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 43.0. That's an absolute error of 13.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 40.8% of my recent predictions.
