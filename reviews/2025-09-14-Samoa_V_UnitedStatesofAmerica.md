# Samoa V United States of America on 2025/09/14, 13.0 to 29.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Samoa to win by 4.17, and United States of America won by 16.0. That's an absolute error of 20.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 24.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 42.0. That's an absolute error of 8.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 62.3% of my recent predictions.
