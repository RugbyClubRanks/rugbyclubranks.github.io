# Samoa V United States of America on 2025/09/14, 13.0 to 29.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Samoa to win by 3.48, and United States of America won by 16.0. That's an absolute error of 19.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 25.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 42.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 57.1% of my recent predictions.
