# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Doncaster to win by 4.99, and Doncaster won by 3.0. That's an absolute error of 2.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 89.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 57.5 and we have an actual total of 45.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 43.2% of my recent predictions.
