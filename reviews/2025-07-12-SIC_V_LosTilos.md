# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted SIC to win by 5.58, and SIC won by 12.0. That's an absolute error of 6.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 68.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 44.0. That's an absolute error of 5.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 75.5% of my recent predictions.
