# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Dax to win by 0.09, and Dax won by 5.0. That's an absolute error of 4.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 74.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 21.0. That's an absolute error of 26.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 10.7% of my recent predictions.
