# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted South Africa to win by 0.12, and South Africa won by 11.0. That's an absolute error of 10.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 47.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 37.0. That's an absolute error of 14.5 compared to a six month average of 13.1. This prediction was more accurate than 36.5% of my recent predictions.
