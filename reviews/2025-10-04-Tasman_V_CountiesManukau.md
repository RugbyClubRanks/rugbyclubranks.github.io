# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Tasman to win by 2.66, and Counties Manukau won by 8.0. That's an absolute error of 10.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 16.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 54.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 90.0. That's an absolute error of 35.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 4.7% of my recent predictions.
