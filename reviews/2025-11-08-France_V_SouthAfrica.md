# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted France to win by 0.62, and South Africa won by 15.0. That's an absolute error of 15.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 32.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 49.0. That's an absolute error of 7.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 63.4% of my recent predictions.
