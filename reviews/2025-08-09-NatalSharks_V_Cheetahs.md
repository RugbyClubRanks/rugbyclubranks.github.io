# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Natal Sharks to win by 3.08, and Cheetahs won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 5.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 74.3% of my recent predictions.
