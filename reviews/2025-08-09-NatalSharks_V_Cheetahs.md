# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Natal Sharks to win by 8.6, and Cheetahs won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 10.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 50.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 59.5 and we have an actual total of 12.0. That's an absolute error of 47.5 compared to a six month average of 14.1. This prediction was more accurate than 1.6% of my recent predictions.
