# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand A to win by 16.99, and New Zealand A won by 24.0. That's an absolute error of 7.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 64.1% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 66.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 54.3% of my recent predictions.
