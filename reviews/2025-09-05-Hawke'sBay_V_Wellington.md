# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Hawke's Bay to win by 2.03, and Hawke's Bay won by 26.0. That's an absolute error of 24.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 17.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 57.5 and we have an actual total of 64.0. That's an absolute error of 6.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 69.5% of my recent predictions.
