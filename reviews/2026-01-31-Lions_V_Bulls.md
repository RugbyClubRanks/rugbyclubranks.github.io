# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Lions to win by 3.0, and Bulls won by 35.0. That's an absolute error of 38.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.3 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 5.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 69.0. That's an absolute error of 19.5 compared to a six month average of 12.5. This prediction was more accurate than 20.1% of my recent predictions.
