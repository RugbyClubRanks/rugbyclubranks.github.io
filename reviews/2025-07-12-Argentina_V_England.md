# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Argentina to win by 3.33, and England won by 5.0. That's an absolute error of 8.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 58.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 39.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 45.2% of my recent predictions.
