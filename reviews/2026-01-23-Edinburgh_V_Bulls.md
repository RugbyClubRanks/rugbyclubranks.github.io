# Edinburgh V Bulls on 2026/01/23, 17.0 to 19.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Edinburgh to win by 2.23, and Bulls won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 4.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 78.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 36.0. That's an absolute error of 18.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 24.8% of my recent predictions.
