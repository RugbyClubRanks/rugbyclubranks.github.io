# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Fiji to win by 6.56, and Fiji won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 7.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 65.9% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 44.0. That's an absolute error of 10.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 53.3% of my recent predictions.
