# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand U20 to win by 6.85, and New Zealand U20 won by 19. That's an absolute error of 12.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 44.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 57. That's an absolute error of 6.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 71.0% of my recent predictions.
