# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Chinnor to win by 8.73, and Chinnor won by 40.0. That's an absolute error of 31.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 9.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 67.5 and we have an actual total of 70.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 12.9. This prediction was more accurate than 87.4% of my recent predictions.
