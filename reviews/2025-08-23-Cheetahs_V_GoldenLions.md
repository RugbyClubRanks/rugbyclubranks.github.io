# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Golden Lions to win by 1.94, and Cheetahs won by 16.0. That's an absolute error of 17.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.3 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 28.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 78.0. That's an absolute error of 23.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 17.3% of my recent predictions.
