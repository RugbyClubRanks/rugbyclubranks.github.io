# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Suresnes to win by 0.94, and Perigueux won by 11.0. That's an absolute error of 11.9 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 44.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 41.5 and we have an actual total of 29.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 13.4. This prediction was more accurate than 44.1% of my recent predictions.
