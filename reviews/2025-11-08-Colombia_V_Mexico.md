# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Colombia to win by 2.21, and Colombia won by 9.0. That's an absolute error of 6.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 65.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 52.5 and we have an actual total of 59.0. That's an absolute error of 6.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 69.3% of my recent predictions.
