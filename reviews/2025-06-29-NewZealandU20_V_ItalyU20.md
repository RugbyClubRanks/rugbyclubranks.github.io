# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted New Zealand U20 to win by 11.37, and New Zealand U20 won by 9. That's an absolute error of 2.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 88.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 59.5 and we have an actual total of 19. That's an absolute error of 40.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 2.6% of my recent predictions.
