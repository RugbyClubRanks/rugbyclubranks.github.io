# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted South Africa to win by 2.97, and South Africa won by 2.0. That's an absolute error of 1.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 16.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 96.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 57.5 and we have an actual total of 56.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 92.6% of my recent predictions.
