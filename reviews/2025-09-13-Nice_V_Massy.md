# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Nice to win by 2.07, and Nice won by 17.0.

This prediction was more accurate than 36.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 44.5 and we have an actual total of 53.0. That's an absolute error of 8.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 62.3% of my recent predictions.
