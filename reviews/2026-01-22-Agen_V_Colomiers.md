# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Agen to win by 0.16, and Colomiers won by 10.0. That's an absolute error of 10.2 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 48.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 26.0. That's an absolute error of 21.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 17.7% of my recent predictions.
