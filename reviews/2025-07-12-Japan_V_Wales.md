# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Japan to win by 1.61, and Wales won by 9.0. That's an absolute error of 10.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 48.6% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 53.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 93.2% of my recent predictions.
