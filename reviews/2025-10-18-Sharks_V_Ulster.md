# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Sharks to win by 4.7, and Ulster won by 8.0. That's an absolute error of 12.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.9 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 42.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 44.5 and we have an actual total of 60.0. That's an absolute error of 15.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 35.9% of my recent predictions.
