# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Massy to win by 3.1, and Massy won by 3.0. That's an absolute error of 0.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.5 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 99.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 43.5 and we have an actual total of 23.0. That's an absolute error of 20.5 compared to a six month average of 12.7. This prediction was more accurate than 19.8% of my recent predictions.
