Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Italy U20 to win by 1.36, and Australia U20 won by 23.0. That's an absolute error of 24.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 15.0% of my recent predictions.
