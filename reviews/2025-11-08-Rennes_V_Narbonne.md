# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Narbonne to win by 1.99, and Rennes won by 5.0. That's an absolute error of 7.0 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 64.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 41.5 and we have an actual total of 11.0. That's an absolute error of 30.5 compared to a six month average of 13.2. This prediction was more accurate than 6.5% of my recent predictions.
