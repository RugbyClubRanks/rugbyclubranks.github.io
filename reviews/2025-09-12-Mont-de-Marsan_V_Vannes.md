# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Vannes to win by 0.22, and Mont-de-Marsan won by 2.0.

This prediction was more accurate than 88.9% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 58.0. That's an absolute error of 6.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 69.4% of my recent predictions.
