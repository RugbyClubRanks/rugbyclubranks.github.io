# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Leinster to win by 8.73, and Leinster won by 35.0. That's an absolute error of 26.3 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 14.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 47.5 and we have an actual total of 69.0. That's an absolute error of 21.5 compared to a six month average of 12.5. This prediction was more accurate than 16.8% of my recent predictions.
