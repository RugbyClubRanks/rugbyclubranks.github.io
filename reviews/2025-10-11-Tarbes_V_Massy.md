# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Tarbes to win by 1.09, and Massy won by 25.0. That's an absolute error of 26.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.0 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 14.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 42.5 and we have an actual total of 37.0. That's an absolute error of 5.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 75.2% of my recent predictions.
