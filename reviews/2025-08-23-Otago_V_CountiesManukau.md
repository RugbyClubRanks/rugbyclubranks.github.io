# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Counties Manukau to win by 0.1, and Otago won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 14.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.3 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 38.7% of my recent predictions.
