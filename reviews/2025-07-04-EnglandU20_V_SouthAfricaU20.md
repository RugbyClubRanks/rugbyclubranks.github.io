# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted England U20 to win by 4.12, and South Africa U20 won by 10.0. That's an absolute error of 14.1 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 37.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 55.5 and we have an actual total of 54.0. That's an absolute error of 1.5 compared to a six month average of 13.6. This prediction was more accurate than 92.2% of my recent predictions.
