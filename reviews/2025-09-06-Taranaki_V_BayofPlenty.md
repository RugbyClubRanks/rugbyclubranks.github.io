# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Taranaki to win by 6.51, and Bay of Plenty won by 26.0. That's an absolute error of 32.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 8.3% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 60.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 13.8. This prediction was more accurate than 57.4% of my recent predictions.
