# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted North Harbour to win by 2.8, and Taranaki won by 22.0. That's an absolute error of 24.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 15.7% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 58.5 and we have an actual total of 70.0. That's an absolute error of 11.5 compared to a six month average of 14.1. This prediction was more accurate than 49.8% of my recent predictions.
