# Waikato V Wellington on 2025/08/08, 24.0 to 35.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Waikato to win by 7.5, and Wellington won by 11.0. That's an absolute error of 18.5 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 27.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 54.5 and we have an actual total of 59.0. That's an absolute error of 4.5 compared to a six month average of 14.1. This prediction was more accurate than 80.3% of my recent predictions.
