# Australia V New Zealand on 2025/10/04, 14.0 to 28.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Australia to win by 3.69, and New Zealand won by 14.0. That's an absolute error of 17.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 16.6 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 35.1% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 42.0. That's an absolute error of 9.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 57.5% of my recent predictions.
