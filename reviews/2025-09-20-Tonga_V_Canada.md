# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Tonga to win by 4.28, and Tonga won by 11.0. That's an absolute error of 6.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 69.2% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 56.5 and we have an actual total of 59.0. That's an absolute error of 2.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 88.3% of my recent predictions.
