# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Taranaki to win by 0.64, and Taranaki won by 42.0. That's an absolute error of 41.4 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 4.4% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 50.5 and we have an actual total of 58.0. That's an absolute error of 7.5 compared to a six month average of 14.0. This prediction was more accurate than 65.8% of my recent predictions.
