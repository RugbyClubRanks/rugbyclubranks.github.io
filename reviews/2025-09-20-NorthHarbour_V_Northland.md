# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Northland to win by 2.72, and Northland won by 1.0. That's an absolute error of 1.7 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.7 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 91.8% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 55.5 and we have an actual total of 43.0. That's an absolute error of 12.5 compared to a six month average of 13.7. This prediction was more accurate than 45.2% of my recent predictions.
