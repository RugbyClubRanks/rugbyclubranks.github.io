# Sharks V Lions on 2026/01/03, 22.0 to 23.0

# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted Sharks to win by 2.64, and Lions won by 1.0. That's an absolute error of 3.6 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 13.8 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 82.0% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 49.5 and we have an actual total of 45.0. That's an absolute error of 4.5 compared to a six month average of 12.5. This prediction was more accurate than 77.1% of my recent predictions.
