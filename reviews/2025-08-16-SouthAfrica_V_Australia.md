# Club Level Predictions


Now that the game has been played, lets see how the club predictions did. I predicted South Africa to win by 12.78, and Australia won by 16.0. That's an absolute error of 28.8 for the margin of victory, while my average absolute error has been 14.2 over the past six months. This prediction was more accurate than 10.5% of my recent predictions.

For the Over/Under model, I predicted a total of 51.5 and we have an actual total of 60.0. That's an absolute error of 8.5 compared to a six month average of 13.9. This prediction was more accurate than 61.1% of my recent predictions.
