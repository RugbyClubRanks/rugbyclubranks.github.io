# Model Review

After 6, our club level model is 5 of 6, and the player models are 6 of 6. Interestingly, the player model was a bit less accurate than the club model for the Ireland v France match, which may point to a bit of an overvaluation of Irish players, or an undervaluation of French players. If such a misevaluation exists, it may be caused by the separation of the Top 14 and the URC, as those clubs would only really play in the ERCC tournaments. Both tournaments are underway, but clubs may have put out some sub-par sides in the group stages. 

All number are using the most recent models, and always predict a match using only data available before that match kicks off. Except for the Player Minutes model, of course, as we need the match to be played to see how long any player is on the field.
